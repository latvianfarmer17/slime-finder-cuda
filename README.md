# Slime Finder: CUDA
This is a program which utilises the CUDA API for **NVIDIA** GPUs to heavily improve the searching capabilities of slime chunks in Minecraft.

This program has four modes of searching for slime chunks:
- Pattern - *look for a specific pattern of slime chunks in some region.*
- Frequency - *look for a specific frequency of slime chunks in some region.*
- Seed Pattern - *look for a specific pattern of slime chunks in some region in a single world seed.*
- Seed Frequency - *look for a specific frequency of slime chunks in some region in a single world seed.*
